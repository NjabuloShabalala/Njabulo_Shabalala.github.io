# Njabulo Shabalala

## Cybersecurity & Cloud Security Professional

<p class="prompt">> Welcome, user. Initializing profile overview...</p>

An emerging cybersecurity professional specializing in **Security Operations (SOC)**, **Cloud Security**, and **Risk Management**. My mission is to build and defend secure digital infrastructures by applying modern defensive strategies and threat intelligence to protect enterprise assets in the cloud.

---

### `[ Current Mission ]`

My primary objective is to translate deep theoretical knowledge into practical, high-impact security skills through continuous development.

- **Skill Validation & Certification:** Actively pursuing industry-recognized certifications, including **(ISC)² CC**, **Microsoft SC-900**, and preparing for the **Microsoft Azure Security Engineer (AZ-500)**.
- **Hands-On Application:** Engaging in practical labs, SOC analyst simulations, and Capture The Flag (CTF) events to sharpen incident response and threat hunting capabilities.
- **Cloud Security Engineering:** Architecting and securing services in **Microsoft Azure** and **AWS**, focusing on implementing security-by-design principles and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

---

### `[ Portfolio Highlights ]`

This portfolio documents my technical projects and learning journey. You'll find a collection of my work demonstrating practical security skills.

- **Threat Detection & Response Scenarios:** Detailed walkthroughs of simulated security incidents—from initial alert triage to remediation—using tools like Splunk, Wireshark, and other SIEM platforms.
- **Secure Cloud Architecture Projects:** Demonstrations of secure cloud configurations in Azure & AWS, including network security groups (NSGs), identity and access management (IAM), and vulnerability management.
- **Technical Write-ups & Research:** In-depth analysis, study guides, and notes on emerging threats, security best practices, and new technologies in the cybersecurity landscape.

---

### `[ Career Objective ]`

To secure a role in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** or **Cloud Security** team where I can apply my defensive skills to protect critical systems and contribute to a robust security posture. My long-term goal is to evolve into a **Cloud Security Architect**, specializing in designing and implementing zero-trust security frameworks for scalable, resilient cloud environments.
